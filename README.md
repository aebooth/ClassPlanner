#Class Planner
A graphical planning tool for teachers to use to keep track of their school year in days.  
It is in very early development now, but the list of future features will hopefully include:
* all-in-one interface for editing all of the little bits of metadata that go with each lesson  
* built-in file storage/handling so that plans can be self-sufficient  
* match day numbers to scheduled days of the school year and be able to see what's happening on a given day
* printable/viewable html day plans with links to resource files
